## Tokenization

The tokenization engine is based on the [syntax](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Language-grammar) created by Mathworks for its integration in IDE's such as VSCode. The syntax is a recursive list of regular expressions, normally read by the [TypeScript engine](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage). The work here hopes also to improve the syntax such to improve the MATLAB [extension](https://github.com/mathworks/matlab-extension-for-vscode) for VSCode. The overview of all the scopes in the syntax is listed below.
